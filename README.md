# LAMP & React Project Guide

This repository contains starter files and guidance for building a full stack web application on the LAMP stack, featuring a React.js client. It is **not** meant to be forked, but instead used as a reference for the structure and organization of a project.

The guides cover the following topics:

1. [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md)
1. [Team Meetings](TEAM_MEETINGS.md)
1. [Style Guides for JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and SQL](CODE_STYLES.md)
1. [Full Stack Development Workflow](FULL_STACK_WORKFLOW.md)
1. [Deployment to EC2 on AWS](DEPLOYMENT.md)

Project Managers (LearningFuze staff) and Developers (LearningFuze students) will be using these guides when delivering project features and conducting team meetings.

Congratulations on making it this far! There is work left to be done, but these guides aim to start you off on solid footing and help you maintain good velocity throughout the project.

Good luck!
